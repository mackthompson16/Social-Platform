Full stack social media repo using js react, want to turn it into some niche social platform. 

Environment Guide for jfred

1. I updated to node 20.18.0 (make sure you reset your environment)
2. npm install
3. make sure you have dependencies:

 "dependencies": {
    "bootstrap": "^5.3.3",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-bootstrap": "^2.10.5",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "react-scripts": "^5.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^4.2.3"
  }
4. cd my-app/src
5. node server.js
6. npm start

Note that the server and the App run on seperate hosts. This can be thought of Frontend and Backend programs communicating with eachother


Current plan is a path generator based on courses using maps API. 
Users can view friend's paths and where they will be/walking at sometime of day.
