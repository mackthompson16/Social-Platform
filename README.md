# ðŸ“… Calendar Sharing & Messaging Platform

A full-stack project where I built a **calendar-sharing and messaging platform** to explore how **data is transferred and managed** across applications.  
This project includes:
- A lightweight **API library**  
- A **Node.js server** for live messaging  
- A **React application** for the frontend

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Initialize a git project and install node modules. You'll need to generate a package.json file as well
```bash
git init
```
```bash
npm install
```
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install bootstrap react react-bootstrap react-scripts react-dom react-datepicker cors sqlite3 web-vitals react-time-picker react-icons ws
```

| **cors**           | Middleware to enable cross-origin requests between server and app.          |

4.  Start the server
```bash 
cd my-app/backend
```
```bash
node server.js
```
5. In a separate terminal, start the React app
```bash
cd my-app
```
```bash
npm start
```

Note: The server and the React app run on separate hosts (frontend and backend communication).
