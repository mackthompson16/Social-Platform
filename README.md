Full stack social media repo using js react, want to turn it into some niche social platform. 

Environment Guide for jfred

1. I updated to node 20.18.0 (make sure you reset your environment)
2. npm install
3. make sure you have all the dependencies:

    "bootstrap" , "react" ,   "react-bootstrap" , "react-scripts"   "react-dom"
                 = > frontend library and components that make css and html a lot better
    "cors"       = > used to communicate from server to app
    "sqlite3"    = > used for storing user data
    "web-vitals" = > reports performance metrics. i.e. such as loading time, interactivity, and stability
  }

5. cd my-app/src
6. node server.js
7. in a seperate terminal (cd my-app), npm start


Note that the server and the App run on seperate hosts. This can be thought of Frontend and Backend programs communicating with eachother


Current plan is a path generator based on courses using maps API. 
Users can view friend's paths and where they will be/walking at sometime of day.
