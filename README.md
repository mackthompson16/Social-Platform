# Full Stack Social Media Repo

# A full stack social media repo using JavaScript and React, with the goal of turning it into a niche social platform.

# Environment Guide for jfred

# 1. Updated to Node.js v20.18.0 (make sure you reset your environment).

# 2. Install dependencies:
npm install

# 3. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
#   "bootstrap", "react", "react-bootstrap", "react-scripts", "react-dom"
#     => Frontend libraries and components that make CSS and HTML easier to work with.
#   "cors" 
#     => Used to communicate between server and app.
#   "sqlite3"
#     => Used for storing user data.
#   "web-vitals"

# 4. Navigate to the src directory
cd my-app/src

# 5. Start the server
node server.js

# 6. In a separate terminal, start the React app

# Path generator based on courses using the Maps API.
# Users can view friends' paths and where they will be or are walking at specific times of the day.
